When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you are ever away from your computer and need to look at your project, git will be the easiest way to do it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You may decide to discard changes.
